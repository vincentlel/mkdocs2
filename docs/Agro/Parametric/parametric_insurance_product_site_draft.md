# Parametric Insurance Data Service

Welcome to the future of agricultural risk management.

---

## 🌾 Value Proposition

Incorporating **parametric insurance** into your agricultural portfolio provides **diversification**, **operational simplicity**, and **new revenue streams**. Yet, insurers often face major hurdles:

- **Data limitations** – especially for environmental variables  
- **Curation complexity** – vegetation data must match land use & crop type  
- **Long historical records** – essential for strike-point calibration  

**EarthDaily Analytics** solves these challenges with a scalable, data-rich platform. Our **Parametric Data API** unlocks over a decade of high-quality environmental, meteorological, soil, and crop-specific vegetation index data, enabling insurers to launch parametric products with confidence.
