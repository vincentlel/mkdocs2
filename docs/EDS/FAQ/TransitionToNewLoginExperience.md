# Transition to New Login Experience


On **March 10, 2025** EarthDaily will switch to the new authentication system as default for all EarthDaily Console sites.
Check out the details - [NewLoginExperience](../../Console/NewLoginExperience) 

Please note
* It is still possible to use the Legacy login system as an option on the login page as shown [here](../../Console/NewLoginExperience#login) 
* You need to replace your old API keys with newly provisioned API keys as described [here](../../Console/NewLoginExperience#api-authentication)
* Please note that your old API credentials will be **deleted** when the legacy authentication system is decommissioned (by late Q2 / early Q3). Hence, we strongly recommend testing and transitioning to the new API token system as soon as possible to ensure uninterrupted service.

Currently the New Login Experience is available as a Preview feature and those of you who haven't tried it yet can follow the instruction below

* [Preview New Login](../PreviewNewLoginExperience)
